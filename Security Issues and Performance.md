# Security Issues and Performance Improvements

## Security Issues

### 1. Exposure of Supabase Credentials in Client Code

**Status:**
- [x] Edge Functions migration complete
- [x] RLS policies updated
- [x] Environment variable handling enforced
- [x] Credentials removed from codebase
- [ ] Monitoring and auditing enabled

**Remaining:**
- Enable and document monitoring and auditing for API usage, uploads, and role changes (Supabase dashboard, logs, and alerting).
- Regularly review audit logs and rotate keys if suspicious activity is detected.

---

### 2. Direct Role Escalation from Client

**Status:**
- [x] Client-side role assignment code removed
- [x] RLS policies updated
- [x] Edge Function-only role management enforced
- [x] Audit logging implemented
- [x] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting enabled

**Remaining:**
- Set up monitoring and alerting for failed or suspicious role change attempts.
- Regularly review audit logs for unusual activity.

### 3. Public Submission Security (CAPTCHA, Rate Limiting, Email Verification)

**Status:**
- [x] Email-based rate limiting (max 3 submissions/hour/email) for all public submission Edge Functions
- [x] Server-side CAPTCHA verification for tech conference registration

**Remaining:**
- Implement CAPTCHA verification for all public submission Edge Functions (not just tech conference registration)
- Implement email verification for public submissions (send confirmation email, require user to click link to finalize submission)
- Implement advanced rate limiting (IP-based, not just email-based) for public submissions

---

### 4. CORS and Security Headers

**Status:**
- [x] CORS and security headers implemented in secure-upload and some Edge Functions

**Remaining:**
- Finalize CORS and security header updates across all Edge Functions (ensure consistent, strict CORS and security headers)

---

### 5. Database Indexes and Performance

**Status:**
- [x] Performance indexes added via migrations

**Remaining:**
- Apply all pending database indexes and monitor performance
- Rollback new indexes if performance degrades

---

### 6. RLS Policy Cleanup

**Status:**
- [x] RLS policies updated for main and archive tables

**Remaining:**
- Remove any remaining public insert RLS policies from migrations

---

### 7. Storage Bucket Security

**Status:**
- [x] Secure-upload Edge Function implemented
- [x] Private bucket folder enforcement in client and Edge Function
- [x] Audit logging for uploads

**Remaining:**
- Finalize storage bucket security and monitoring (audit secure-upload and related RLS/migrations)

---

### 8. Documentation and User Feedback

**Status:**
- [x] Deployment instructions for Edge Functions and .env setup provided
- [x] Checklist of required Edge Functions created

**Remaining:**
- Update documentation and user feedback components as per the security plan
- Audit and update this document and secure-upload with any remaining items as they are completed
